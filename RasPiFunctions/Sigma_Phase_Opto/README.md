# RasPi functions for LC optogenetic manipulation in relation to the phase of sigma power

This software is used in combination with Ypnos software for the optogenetic experiments described in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01822-0. These function are used in conjuction with the Adonis closed-loop system found in the "Adonis" folder.

In the laboratory we are using RasPi of the type described here https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/.

For optogenetic modulation of the LC, we drive the LEDs using the functions InhCon_20m40m (Optogenetic inhibition) and Stm1Hz_30ms_10sWait_20m40m (Optogenetic stimulation). The functions are activated during the first 20 min of each hour of the Raspberry clock time.
