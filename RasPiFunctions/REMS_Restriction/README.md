# RasPi functions for REMS restriction 

This software is used in combination with Ypnos software for REMS restriction experiments described  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01822-0.

In the laboratory we are using RasPi of the type described here https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/.

In order to wake up the animal every time REMS is detected a vibrating motor is attached (using a double-sided tape) on the headstage of the animal.

The motors we are using in the laboratory is of this kind:

and they are directly triggered by the output (0 to 3.3V) of the RasPi. 

## Wiring up

The digital outputs of the Intan board used by Ypnos are fed to the RasPi inputs defined in:
```
ins = (5,6,13,19)
```
for each of the 4 animals we are usually recording simultaneously and with each of the input corresponds to the detection of REM  states dictated by Ypnos in a closed-loop manner (see section for the Ypnos for closed loop experiments).

depending on the calculation performed by those codes the outpouts of the RasPi defined in: 

```
outs = (12,16,20,21)
```
will be connected to the motors in order to start the vibration once REMS is detected as described in  https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.20.541586. We usually start the REMS at 9.00am (ZT0 beginning of the light phase) until 15.00 (ZT6). For questions regarding the code computations please contact the members of the Prof. Anita LÃ¼thi laboratory.
